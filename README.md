# Colab-Notebooks
Here are links to my ready-to-use [Colaboratory Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com), which are set to use the Tesla K80. It's really handy for testing existing models or even creating one yourself from scratch. You just need to have a google drive account. Copy the "notebook" to your google drive (File -> Save a copy in Drive ...). Adapt cells with your data and run in order. A session lasts 12 hours maximum. It is therefore necessary to make backups in this interval at the risk of losing all data !


If you sometimes encounter an error message like "image file is truncated" or "cannot identify image file " during image processing, simply restart the runtime (Runtime -> Restart runtime ... or Ctrl + M)
